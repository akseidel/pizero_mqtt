The LED is a standard 5mm red type with a forward voltage of 2V.

The transistor could be a BC547, BC548 or equivalent.

Resistor R1 limits current through the LED from the 5V pin. If the voltage drop across the LED
 is 2V then voltage across the resistor is 3V. So current is 3/560 = 5.4mA.

Resistor R2 limits current from the GPIO pin. GPIO is either 0v or 3.3V so the maximum current
into base of transistor is 3.3/27000 = 120uA.

Assuming the gain of the transistor is 200 a base current of 120uA would allow a maximum of
 24mA (120uA x 200) to pass through the LED.

R1 could be increased you just need to make sure you allow enough current to power your LED.

R2 could be increased and this would reduce the current drawn from the GPIO pin
but it would reduce the maximum current allowed to flow through the transistor.
